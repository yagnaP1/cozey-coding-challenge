# Frontend Coding Challenge

## Description

This repository contains a project for frontend developers to assess their ability to identify and improve bad practices within a React + TypeScript codebase.

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository.
2. Examine the code in `src/Configurator/index.tsx`.
3. Refactor the code in `index.tsx` to improve structure, readability, performance, and maintainability.
4. After refactoring, record a Loom video explaining:
   - The issues you found with the original code.
   - The changes you made and why.
   - How your changes improve the codebase, with emphasis on readability, performance, or state management.

## How to Submit

1. Make the necessary code changes.
2. Record a Loom video detailing your thought process and the improvements you've made.
3. Submit your refactored code either by:
   - Pushing your changes to your forked repository, or
   - Sharing your modified code.
4. Share the Loom video link with us.

## Tech Stack

- **React** 
- **TypeScript**
- **Styled Components**
- **Axios** (for API requests)

## Goals

- Improve the structure, readability, and maintainability of the code.
- Optimize performance where necessary.
- Ensure better state management and component reusability.

## Deliverables

1. Refactored code in `src/Configurator/index.tsx`.
2. A Loom video explaining your approach to refactoring, the rationale behind your changes, and how the refactored code improves the project.
